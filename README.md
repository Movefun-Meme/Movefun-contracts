# MoveFun - Preventing Rugs with Fair Token Launches 🚀

MoveFun prevents rugs by ensuring that all created tokens are safe. Each coin on MoveFun is a fair-launch with no presale and no team allocation.

## How to Participate in MoveFun 🪙

1. 📊 Pick a coin that you like
2. 💰 Buy the coin on the bonding curve
3. 📈 Sell at any time to lock in your profits or losses
4. 🚀 When enough people buy on the bonding curve and it reaches a market cap of 100_000 MOVE, the token enters the pump phase. In this phase, you can only buy but not sell. If the last buyer is not outbid within 1 hour, they will be awarded 10% of the remaining token supply.
5. 🔥 After that, liquidity is deposited in Razor dex.
